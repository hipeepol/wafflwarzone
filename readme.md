# wafflwarzone
test out github stuff so i can actually code maybe?

oh btw:
"hipeepol" is 6th grade art class lore. basically two people were playing gimkit on the same computer, and we named ourselves "da peepol" with a goofy spelling for the goofy times. In the end, when my friend's crusty school chromebook (not to say mine wasn't crusty, either) was charged, I came up with a solo name.
"waffl" is a shortening of "waffle", obv, and is my name for the mangoduck gang where we draw ducks, make slideshows of ai-generated duck pictures, and say "sped" a lot. we all chose names, mostly based on fruit. i would've chosen "lychee" if my friend hadn't taken it, since lychees are goated.
